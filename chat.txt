Here’s a high-level plan to build your DSR Senior Developer Take-Home Project as described:

Database (PostgreSQL in Docker)

Create a Dockerized PostgreSQL instance.
Design a table (e.g., "records") with fields suitable for large datasets.
Provide a sample CSV file for uploads.
Backend API (Python + FastAPI)

Dockerize the FastAPI app.
Endpoints:
POST /upload: Accepts CSV file uploads, processes them efficiently (streaming, chunked inserts).
GET /records: Returns paginated, filterable data.
Implement basic authentication with two roles (uploader/viewer).
Add error handling, logging, and validation.
Frontend (React)

Dockerize the React app.
Login screen (basic auth).
Upload screen (visible only to uploaders).
Data table with filtering and pagination.
Docker Compose

Compose file to orchestrate all services.
README with clear instructions.
Next, I’ll scaffold the project structure and start with the Docker Compose and database setup.

Created backend

Created frontend

Created db

Created docker-compose.yml

Created init.sql

Created sample.csv

Created README.md

README.md+43-0
Created Dockerfile

Created requirements.txt

Created main.py

Created Dockerfile

Created package.json

Created src

Created Login.js

Created Upload.js

Created DataTable.js

Created App.js

Created index.js

Created index.html

The project is now scaffolded with:

Docker Compose for PostgreSQL, FastAPI backend, and React frontend
Database schema and sample CSV
FastAPI backend with secure endpoints, file upload, filtering, and pagination
React frontend with login, upload (uploader only), and data table
You can now run docker compose build and docker compose up as described in the README to start the application. Let me know if you want to add tests, logging, or any enhancements!
